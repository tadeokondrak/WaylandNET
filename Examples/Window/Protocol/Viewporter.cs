    /// 
    /// This interface works with two concepts: the source rectangle (src_x,
    /// src_y, src_width, src_height), and the destination size (dst_width,
    /// dst_height). The contents of the source rectangle are scaled to the
    /// destination size, and content outside the source rectangle is ignored.
    /// This state is double-buffered, and is applied on the next
    /// wl_surface.commit.
    /// 
    /// The two parts of crop and scale state are independent: the source
    /// rectangle, and the destination size. Initially both are unset, that
    /// is, no scaling is applied. The whole of the current wl_buffer is
    /// used as the source, and the surface size is as defined in
    /// wl_surface.attach.
    /// 
    /// If the destination size is set, it causes the surface size to become
    /// dst_width, dst_height. The source (rectangle) is scaled to exactly
    /// this size. This overrides whatever the attached wl_buffer size is,
    /// unless the wl_buffer is NULL. If the wl_buffer is NULL, the surface
    /// has no content and therefore no size. Otherwise, the size is always
    /// at least 1x1 in surface local coordinates.
    /// 
    /// If the source rectangle is set, it defines what area of the wl_buffer is
    /// taken as the source. If the source rectangle is set and the destination
    /// size is not set, then src_width and src_height must be integers, and the
    /// surface size becomes the source rectangle size. This results in cropping
    /// without scaling. If src_width or src_height are not integers and
    /// destination size is not set, the bad_size protocol error is raised when
    /// the surface state is applied.
    /// 
    /// The coordinate transformations from buffer pixel coordinates up to
    /// the surface-local coordinates happen in the following order:
    /// 1. buffer_transform (wl_surface.set_buffer_transform)
    /// 2. buffer_scale (wl_surface.set_buffer_scale)
    /// 3. crop and scale (wp_viewport.set*)
    /// This means, that the source rectangle coordinates of crop and scale
    /// are given in the coordinates after the buffer transform and scale,
    /// i.e. in the coordinates that would be the surface-local coordinates
    /// if the crop and scale was not applied.
    /// 
    /// If src_x or src_y are negative, the bad_value protocol error is raised.
    /// Otherwise, if the source rectangle is partially or completely outside of
    /// the non-NULL wl_buffer, then the out_of_buffer protocol error is raised
    /// when the surface state is applied. A NULL wl_buffer does not raise the
    /// out_of_buffer error.
    /// 
    /// If the wl_surface associated with the wp_viewport is destroyed,
    /// all wp_viewport requests except 'destroy' raise the protocol error
    /// no_surface.
